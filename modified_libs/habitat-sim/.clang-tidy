# Let deprecation warnings through. From time to time, Magnum annotates APIs
# with deprecation warnings, suggesting people to upgrade to newer / better
# designed / more flexible APIs. Treating such warnings as error is
# counterproductive, since the first thing you want to do after an upgrade is
# compiling existing *unchanged* code and ensuring all tests pass, and only
# then start updating the code.
